  This last card exists as a cover at the end. The user should not interact
  with this one, rather when the user sees this on top, there's 0.5 seconds
  until the tutorial screen is popped.

  When the last card is swiped away, gameProvider.isTutorial is set to false
  immediately. Because of the animation of the page, the user will see a flash
  of the end of deck menu, and they are not suppoed to (that menu is disabled
  anyways on the tutorial).
